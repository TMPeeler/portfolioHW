The goal of this assignment was to create a portolio via website. The website was to be built using our foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS.
The website was to have our name, links to an about, work, and contact sections.
Clicking links of image sections is supposed to take you to the deployed page for each demo (although we currently do not have any of those working)
The first demo was to be displayed larger than the others
Each demo was supposed to have a titled section related to the work

## Getting Started

I started a fresh repo and started generating all my files, then I started coding the page in HTML and adding all of its containers and content. After that the page was styled with CSS.

### Prerequisites

In order to accomplish the goal of this assignment, I had to use VSCode for the HTML and CSS work as well as Gitbash for moving files between my repository and local machine. I also used Github to create the repository that I was sending to. 

### Solving

I pretty much linked all my css sheets and started going. I first placed as many semantic HTML tags as I could with vague basis for what I wanted them to be like. I tried to add notes for the parts of my page that were related to the initial asking of the assignment (work,contact,about,etc). I encountered many issues afterwards and even rebuild the entire CSS and HTML pages multiple times while attempting to make it look somewhat presentable. I found that after outlining the basic pieces that I could go ahead and style those pieces in a particular manner, creating a header, footer, and body section that felt they had met the needs of the assignment. After that, I did a lot of research and asked my classmates and teachers questions relating to flex and its relationship with images or boxes. Eventually I created a grid of the images and found that I could make one of them bigger by adding it as a background image defined in the CSS instead.

## Code snippet of important work:

@media (max-width:768px) {

    header{
       width: 100%;
    }
    .otherImage{
        width: 300px;
        
    }
}
^^^ this part was very crucial to making sure that the site didn't break on mobile
